Online dating, these days, has changed dramatically. Most strikingly, websites like OKCupid have captured an enormous amount of data on its users, which can then be used to unlock trends in what its users' tastes and behaviors are. An exploratory data analysis will be done on the dataset of the OKCupid profiles for gaining insight into driving factors that make the users interact and show preferences in the dating space.

The dynamics of building the profile and going through the process are very important to understand, which will not only help the user but also provide extended chances of developing more alluring profiles and, hence, maximizing the dating experience. On the other hand, analysis could be cumbersome because many elements come into play, such as age, gender, interests, and location.

We have downloaded a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle that included several features in the demographic, profile description, and user preference aspects. We have many thousands of profiles on which we will be carrying out EDA, observing the trends, looking for correlations, and visualizing these onto plots for clarity. Hence, we try to give valuable insights that might be helpful for users as well as adding to the literature on online dating behavior.

SMART questions :

2. Does the drinking habit of a person explain, with finality, the body type of that person?
3. Is the status of a person gender dependent?
4. Which category of educated people is more prone to taking drugs?
